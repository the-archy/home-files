I recommend browsing all the files if you find anything that you know is imcompatible with your setup.
Some of the settings are borrowed from dotfiles of my friends:
- https://github.com/Johnystar/.dotfiles-management
- https://github.com/Call-Me-Apro

Config files for:
- [openbox-patched](https://github.com/dylanaraps/openbox-patched)
  - Inclueds rounded corners 
  - You may want to change autostart
  - My config has Windows-like window snaping

- [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)
  - Here I really recommend checking the config especially if you're using an AMD GPU

- [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) and [scripts](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts) (bar)
  - You might check some settings
  - Make sure the scripts are allowed to be executed

- [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- [glava](https://github.com/jarcode-foss/glava)
- [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)

The Arc-based theme was made with [Themix](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox).
